# User Interview — Tracking Consumption Over Time

**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Participant:** Lisa K., 29, apartment tenant in Berlin
**Context:** Lives alone in a 45m² apartment. Has been receiving monthly consumption overviews for 2 years. Works in finance, so is more numbers-literate than average. Still struggles with the letters.
**Interviewer:** Session facilitator
**Duration:** 20 minutes

## Transcript

**Interviewer:** You mentioned you've tried to track your energy consumption. Tell me about that.

**Lisa:** Yes, so I actually do care about this. Partly because I want to keep costs down — energy prices went up a lot in the last few years — and partly because I'm trying to be more environmentally conscious. So when I moved into this apartment, I told myself I'd keep track.

**Interviewer:** How did you approach it?

**Lisa:** At first I tried to just read the letters carefully each month. I'd highlight the key numbers with a marker. But the problem is — and this sounds dumb coming from someone who works in finance — I could never figure out which number was the "real" consumption. There's the raw meter reading, then there's the consumption derived from the difference between readings, then there's a temperature-adjusted version, then there's the cost allocation. Five different numbers, and they all seem to say something different.

**Interviewer:** That's interesting. You're comfortable with numbers professionally but still struggle?

**Lisa:** Exactly. And that tells you something about the design. If I can read a P&L statement but can't understand my warm water bill, the problem isn't me. The problem is the bill. It's like they deliberately made it opaque. I sometimes wonder if that's on purpose — if people don't understand their consumption, they don't complain.

**Interviewer:** What specific information do you wish you had?

**Lisa:** Three things. First: a simple number — how many liters or cubic meters of warm water did I use this month, and what did it cost. Just that. Second: a trend — am I using more or less than three months ago, six months ago, a year ago. A simple line chart would be amazing. Third: context — is my usage normal for a single person in a 45-square-meter apartment? Because right now the comparison they give me is "building average," and my building has families with kids, so of course my consumption is lower. That comparison is meaningless.

**Interviewer:** Have you tried any apps or tools for this?

**Lisa:** I looked. There are some smart meter apps, but my building doesn't have smart meters — it's older construction with traditional meters. There are energy management apps from some providers, but mine doesn't offer one. I thought about using a generic expense tracker but it doesn't have the concept of "consumption" — it only tracks costs, not units.

**Interviewer:** So there's a gap in the market?

**Lisa:** There's a gap for sure. I think the problem is that most solutions assume you have a smart meter or a digital connection to your provider. But millions of people in Germany still get paper letters. We're analog in a digital world, and nobody's building for us.

**Interviewer:** If you could design the perfect solution, what would it look like?

**Lisa:** I'd want to snap a photo of the letter. The app reads it — OCR or whatever — and pulls out the numbers. It stores them month by month. After a few months, I start seeing charts. Maybe it even tells me: "Hey Lisa, your warm water consumption jumped 25% in December — that's typical because of colder weather and holiday guests, nothing to worry about." Or: "Your consumption has been steadily increasing for 4 months — you might want to check if there's a dripping faucet."

**Interviewer:** How important is the "explanation" part versus just the charts?

**Lisa:** Both matter, but the explanation is what makes it sticky. Charts are nice, but I can stare at a chart and not know what it means. If the app tells me *why* something is happening, or at least gives me hypotheses, that's when I actually change my behavior. That's the difference between data and insight.

**Interviewer:** Would you pay for something like this?

**Lisa:** Honestly, probably not as a subscription. But if it saved me even one surprise on the annual bill — last year I paid 200 euros extra — then it pays for itself. I'd pay a one-time fee, maybe 5-10 euros. Or I'd use it for free with ads if the ads weren't too annoying.

## Pain Points Identified

1. **Multiple conflicting numbers** — Raw readings, derived consumption, temperature-adjusted values, cost allocation — unclear which to use
2. **Misleading comparisons** — Building averages mix household sizes and don't provide meaningful benchmarks
3. **No tool for analog users** — Existing apps require smart meters or digital provider integration; paper letter recipients are underserved
4. **Data without insight** — Charts alone aren't enough; users need explanations and hypotheses for behavior change
5. **Cost motivation** — Annual bill surprises are a concrete financial pain point that drives demand
