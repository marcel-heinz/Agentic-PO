## Transcript

**Interviewer:** Thanks for taking the time. Can you walk me through what happens when you get your monthly energy consumption letter?

**Marcel:** Sure. So every month — usually around the 15th — I get this letter in my mailbox. It's from the building management company, forwarded from the energy provider. It's a single A4 page, sometimes front and back.

**Interviewer:** And what do you do with it?

**Marcel:** Honestly? Most months I glance at it for about 10 seconds and put it in a drawer. I know I should pay more attention, but the letter is just... it's not made for humans. It's made for accountants or something.

**Interviewer:** What makes it hard to understand?

**Marcel:** Where do I start? First, there's the layout. It's like a spreadsheet that was printed out — tiny font, lots of columns, abbreviations everywhere. "HKV" for Heizkostenverteiler, "VE" for Verbrauchseinheiten. Then you have the actual numbers — consumption in some unit, but then there's also a "Vergleichszeitraum" (comparison period) and a building average, and I'm never sure if I should compare against my own previous period or against the building.

**Interviewer:** Can you show me one of those letters?

**Marcel:** *[shows a letter]* See — here it says my warm water consumption is 2.3 m³ for this month. Is that a lot? Is that normal? I have no idea. And then here it says the building average is 1.8 m³ per person, but my apartment is shared with my partner, so is the comparison per person or per unit? The letter doesn't say.

**Interviewer:** What would you want instead?

**Marcel:** I want someone to just tell me: "You used this much warm water. That's 15% more than last month. That's above average for your building. Here's why that might be — did you have guests? Was it colder?" You know, like a human explanation, not a data dump.

**Interviewer:** Do you ever try to track your consumption over time?

**Marcel:** I tried once. I actually started a spreadsheet about a year ago. I'd manually type in the numbers from each letter — the consumption value, the cost estimate, the comparison. I did it for maybe four months and then stopped. It was tedious, and honestly I wasn't even sure I was entering the right numbers because the letters are so confusing.

**Interviewer:** What happened to the spreadsheet?

**Marcel:** It's still on my laptop somewhere. Half-filled. I think I had January through April 2025. The problem is I wasn't sure which number to track — the letter has like five different "consumption" values depending on whether it's adjusted for temperature, per square meter, absolute, relative... I just picked one and hoped it was the right one.

**Interviewer:** If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal experience look like?

**Marcel:** I'd take a photo of the letter with my phone, and the app would just... get it. Pull out the important numbers. Show me a chart: "Here's your warm water usage over the last 12 months." Tell me in plain words whether I'm using too much. Maybe flag if something looks weird — like if my consumption doubled for no reason. And ideally, over time, I'd have a history so that when the annual billing comes, I'm not blindsided.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever been blindsided by the annual bill?

**Marcel:** Yes, last year. The "Nebenkostenabrechnung" — the annual utility settlement — said I owed an additional 340 euros. I had no idea my consumption had been creeping up. If I'd been tracking it monthly, I might have noticed and done something about it. That's 340 euros I could have partially avoided.

**Interviewer:** That's a concrete cost. How did that make you feel?

**Marcel:** Frustrated. And a bit stupid, honestly. The data was there every month in those letters. I just couldn't be bothered to decode them. The letters are designed for compliance, not for helping the tenant.

**Interviewer:** Last question: if an app like this existed, how often would you use it?

**Marcel:** Once a month, when the letter arrives. Maybe I'd check the charts more often if I was actively trying to reduce consumption. I think the key is that the upload has to be dead simple — snap a photo, done. If I have to manually enter anything, I'll stop using it within two months. Guaranteed.

## Pain Points Identified

1. **Incomprehensible format** — Letters are dense, use abbreviations, and present data without context
2. **No longitudinal tracking** — Each letter exists in isolation; no easy way to see trends over time
3. **Ambiguous comparisons** — Per-person vs. per-unit, temperature-adjusted vs. absolute — confusing
4. **Annual bill surprise** — Monthly ignorance leads to expensive surprises at year-end settlement
5. **Manual effort barrier** — Tried spreadsheet tracking, abandoned after 4 months due to friction
