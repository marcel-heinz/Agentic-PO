# User Personas

## Persona 1: Marcel — "The Overwhelmed Tenant"

- **Age:** 34
- **Location:** Munich, Germany
- **Living situation:** Shared apartment (2 people), multi-unit building
- **Technical comfort:** Uses smartphone daily, but not tech-savvy beyond basics
- **Relationship with energy data:** Receives monthly letters, barely reads them. Tried a spreadsheet once, abandoned it.

### Job to Be Done
> When I receive my monthly consumption letter, I want to quickly understand whether my usage is normal, so that I'm not blindsided by the annual settlement bill.

### Key Behaviors
- Glances at letter for ~10 seconds, puts it in a drawer
- Motivated by avoiding unexpected costs
- Will not invest manual effort — needs frictionless input
- Triggered to care once a year when the "Nebenkostenabrechnung" arrives

### Frustrations
- "The letter is not made for humans"
- Abbreviations and dense tables are incomprehensible
- Unclear which of the five numbers is "his" consumption
- No way to see trends over time

### Success looks like
- Snap a photo, get a plain-language summary in 30 seconds
- See a chart of the last 12 months
- Get alerted if something looks unusual

## Persona 2: Lisa — "The Data-Driven Optimizer"

- **Age:** 29
- **Location:** Berlin, Germany
- **Living situation:** Lives alone, 45m² apartment, older building
- **Technical comfort:** Works in finance, very comfortable with numbers
- **Relationship with energy data:** Actively wants to track and optimize, but frustrated by the format

### Job to Be Done
> When I track my energy consumption month over month, I want to understand trends and get explanations for changes, so that I can actively reduce my usage and costs.

### Key Behaviors

- Charts without explanations don't drive behavior change

### Success looks like
- Monthly trend charts with clear units
- Contextual benchmarks (single person, similar apartment size)
- Plain-language explanations for consumption changes
- Proactive alerts for anomalies
