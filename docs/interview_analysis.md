# Interview Analysis — Research Baseline

**Source:** 2 user interviews (Marcel H., Lisa K.) — January 2026
**Purpose:** Establish baseline for problem statement

---

## Jobs to Be Done

1. **Understand my consumption at a glance** — "Just tell me how much I used and whether that's a lot" (both Marcel & Lisa)
2. **Track trends over time** — See monthly consumption as a line chart to spot creeping increases before the annual bill hits
3. **Get plain-language explanations** — Not just data, but *why* consumption changed ("colder month? guests? leak?")
4. **Avoid annual bill surprises** — Marcel got hit with €340 extra, Lisa with €200. Monthly awareness = early intervention
5. **Digitize paper letters effortlessly** — Snap a photo, done. Zero manual data entry (Marcel: "If I have to manually enter anything, I'll stop using it within two months.")

## Pain Points

| Pain Point | Marcel | Lisa | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Incomprehensible format** — abbreviations, tiny fonts, data-dump layout | ✅ | ✅ | High |
| **Too many numbers** — raw reading, derived, temperature-adjusted, cost-allocated. Which one matters? | ✅ | ✅ | High |
| **Meaningless comparisons** — building average mixes family sizes, per-person vs. per-unit unclear | ✅ | ✅ | High |
| **No longitudinal view** — each letter exists in isolation, no trend visibility | ✅ | ✅ | High |
| **Manual tracking fails** — Marcel quit his spreadsheet after 4 months, too much friction | ✅ | — | Medium |
| **No tools for analog users** — apps require smart meters or digital provider integration | — | ✅ | High |
| **Annual bill shock** — €340 (Marcel), €200 (Lisa) surprise at Nebenkostenabrechnung | ✅ | ✅ | High |
| **Letters designed for compliance, not comprehension** — "not made for humans" | ✅ | ✅ | High |

## What Works Already Well (for the users today)

- **Letters do arrive reliably** — monthly cadence is consistent (~15th of the month)
- **The data is all there** — consumption values, comparisons, building averages exist on paper; the raw information is sufficient, just poorly presented
- **Users are motivated** — both participants *want* to track, they just lack a usable tool
- **Comparison data exists** — previous month, previous year, building average are included (just poorly contextualized)

## Key Behavioral Insights

- **Usage frequency = once/month** — aligned with letter arrival cadence. Not a daily app.
- **Photo-first workflow is non-negotiable** — any manual entry = abandonment
- **Explanation > visualization > raw data** — Lisa nailed it: "Charts are nice, but the explanation is what makes it sticky. That's the difference between data and insight."
- **Financial motivation is the strongest driver** — not environmentalism, not curiosity. It's "I don't want to pay €340 I didn't expect."
- **Even number-literate people struggle** — Lisa works in finance and still can't parse the bills. The problem is the letter design, not user competence.

## Willingness to Pay

- Marcel: didn't mention price, but the €340 surprise is his reference frame
- Lisa: would pay **€5–10 one-time**, not a subscription. Free with ads is acceptable. The annual bill savings justify it.

## Problem Statement (Baseline)

**German tenants receive monthly consumption letters they can't understand, can't track, and can't act on — leading to hundreds of euros in avoidable annual bill surprises.**
